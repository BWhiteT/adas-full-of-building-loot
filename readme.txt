Readme Instructions To Add Complete ADA 4x4s Full Of Building Loot To DayZ Chernarus or Livonia

By applying these edits your players will easily be able to find ADAs at almost every potential spawn point by
using the Izurvive map and filtering the car spawns to just show ADAs.
Inside the ADAs will be a fuel can and lots of useful building equipment.
The ADAs will have all their parts installed.
To drive the cars players simply to need to fuel the car from the can, then find some water, fill the can,
then fill the cars radiator with water.

There are seperate events snippets for Chernarus and Livonia because the maps have a different number of potential ADA spawn points.

Tested with DayZ version 1.07. Should work fine with future versions, unless number of vehicle spawns are changed,
or they add the requirement to put oil into engines.

Please backup any files you will be working on before doing these edits.

Please stop your server before doing these edits.

I recommend doing the edits locally, using a text editor such as Notepad ++ rather than in the HTML browser editor on your server.

These snippets must be copied and pasted over exisiting code.

Each file has their own instructions.

For the changes to quickly take effect you'd need to do a fresh install, but that would wipe everybodies progress.
If you add the code snippets to an unwiped server, the modded Ada's will slowly replace the empty ones over time.
